# CAE-Code-Generation-Service
This service mainly handles the code generation of the Community Application
Editor.
It is used by the [Model Persistence Service](https://github.com/rwth-acis/CAE-Model-Persistence-Service).

## Are you looking for the official CAE instance?
If you just want to try out the Community Application Editor you don't need to set up your own environment. For building applications there are the following spaces:
* [Microservice Editor](http://cloud10.dbis.rwth-aachen.de:8081/spaces/CAEMicroservice)
* [Frontend Widget Editor](http://cloud10.dbis.rwth-aachen.de:8081/spaces/CAEFrontend)
* [Application Editor](http://cloud10.dbis.rwth-aachen.de:8081/spaces/CAEApplication)

## Installation
For information on how to install the CAE take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/rwth-acis/CAE/wiki/Deployment-and-Configuration).
